# "CombineBot" Project

CombineBot is a bot for Telegram that I use for learning purposes. Here I add as many features as I can in order for me to test them and remember the path I`ve done. 

### Current features:
- **Greeting user** _(yeah, he knows your name but not only that...)_
- **Echo bot** _(basically sends you back whatever you text him)_
- **Guess number game** _(just send him some number and let`s see if you can win the bot)_
- **Sending pictures of cute cats** _(what can be better than that right?)_
- **Weather service** _(you will not forget to take your umbrella with this bro)_
- **Words counting** _(just counts how many words you texted him in one message. Why? Because it can)_
- **Next full moon date** _(this little bro will not judge you for that)_
- **Simple calculator** _(works with 2 digits only for now, but maybe in future this bot will be a bit worse than Pythagoras)_
- **Location** _(you don`t need to use your sextant anymore)_
- **Word chain game** _(you don`t have any chances to win that beast)_
- **To be continued...**
